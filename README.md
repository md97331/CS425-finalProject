# SQL Project
Spring 2023 CS425 Final Project Repository

## Connection
Use the SQL code created in MySQL to be used with Java to create an application in the terminal.

## Application
Our application will have a menu with prompts, each being a table to work with and query.
We will have both users and administrators. Users will be able to search and query while administrators will be able to modify data. 

## Menu
You will be prompted with the following options after logging in
```bash
1. Class type
2. Flight
3. Passenger
4. Ticket
5. Payment
6. Conncetion
7. Exit
```
Exit will close the application. Reopening will prompt the user for the login again.

## Table
Selecting the Flight table will further prompt the user with the following
```bash
1. Search Flights by Flight ID
2. Search Flights by Destination and Origin
3. Back
```

## Searching Flights by Destination and Origin
You will then be asked with providing a Destination and Origin which will be passed through and queried. 

## Searching Flights by Flight ID
Will provide the information of the Flight with said Flight ID
