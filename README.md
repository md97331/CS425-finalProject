# SQL Project
Spring 2023 CS425 Final Project Repository

## Connection
Use the SQL code created in MySQL to be used with Java to create an application in the terminal.

## Application
Our application will have a menu with prompts, each being a table to work with and query.
We will have both users and administrators. Users will be able to search and query while administrators will be able to add and book tickets

## Menu
You will be prompted with the following options after logging in
```bash
1. Class type
2. Flight
3. Passenger
4. Ticket
5. Payment
6. Conncetion
7. Exit
```
Exit will close the application. Reopening will prompt the user for the login again.

## Table
Selecting the Flight table will further prompt the user with the following
```bash
1. Search Flights by Flight ID
2. Search Flights by Destination and Origin
3. Back
```

## Searching Flights by Destination and Origin
You will then be asked with providing a Destination and Origin which will be passed through and queried. 

## Searching Flights by Flight ID
Will provide the information of the Flight with said Flight ID
